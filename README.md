# Cardiac Risk Factors - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of cardiac risk factors using a health-related dataset. The objective is to investigate factors that may influence or correlate with the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this notebook is to:

- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
- Identify key risk factors contributing to heart disease
- Perform visual and statistical exploration of health indicators
- Draw meaningful insights from trends, patterns, and correlations

## 📊 Dataset Overview

> *(Assuming the dataset is included or referenced inside the notebook)*

The dataset includes various attributes such as:

- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Smoking habits**
- **Physical activity levels**
- **Alcohol consumption**
- **Mental and physical health days**
- **Blood pressure and cholesterol indicators**
- **Diabetes status**
- **Sex and age demographics**

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values
- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Correlation Heatmap
- Visualization using:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Countplots
  - Heatmaps
  - Pairplots
- Feature Relationships with Target (`Heart Disease`)

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly` *(optional if used)*
- `scikit-learn` *(optional if any ML used)*

## 📌 Key Insights

- Certain lifestyle factors like **smoking**, **obesity**, **lack of physical activity**, and **alcohol use** significantly correlate with increased risk of heart disease.
- **Age** and **gender** also play a notable role in the risk levels.
- The correlation matrix revealed multicollinearity between several features.
